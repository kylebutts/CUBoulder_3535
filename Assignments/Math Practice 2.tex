\subsection*{Two period model of a non-renewable resource}

Consider extraction of a non-renewable natural resource. The inverse demand function for the depletable resource is $P = 12 - Q$ in both periods $1$ and $2$ and the marginal cost of supplying it is $\$3$. The discount rate is $10\%$. There are $7.5$ units total.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Find the equilibrium allocation in each period for resource extraction

  \item Describe using the concept of marignal user cost why $Q_1 = 3$ and $Q_2 = 4.5$ is not optimal

  \item What is the marginal user cost? Interpret this number.

  \item Now assume $r = 0$. What is the optimal allocation now? Why did it change in the direction that it did?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Two period model of a non-renewable resource}

Consider extraction of a non-renewable natural resource. The inverse demand function for the depletable resource is $P = 12 - Q$ in both periods $1$ and $2$ and the marginal cost of supplying it is $2 + Q/2$. The discount rate is $6\%$. There are $15\$$ units total.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Find the equilibrium allocation in each period for resource extraction

  \item What is the marginal user cost? Interpret this number.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Tradable Permits}

Two firms can control emissions at the following marginal costs: $MC_1 = 200 a_x$ and $MC_2 = 100 a_y$ where $a_x$ and $a_y$ are, respectively, the amount of emissions reduced by the first and second firms. Assume that with no control at all, each firm would be emitting $20$ units of emissions or a total of $40$ units for both firms.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Consider a cap-and-trade system that aims for a total reduction of $21$ units of emissions is necessary. 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the equilibrium allocation of permits to each firm?
    \item At what price would these permits sell for at an auction
  \end{enumerate}

  \item Assume that the control authority wanted to reach its objective by using an emissions
  charge system instead.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item What tax amount should them impose to reach this equilibrium?
    \item How much revenue would the government collect?
  \end{enumerate}

  \item Why is cap-and-trade more cost-effective than a uniform standard where each firm reduces pollution by $10.5$ units?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Tradable Permits}


Two firms can control emissions at the following marginal costs: $ MC_1 = 5 + 10 a_x $ and $MC_2 = 11 a_y$ where $a_x$ and $a_y$ are, respectively, the amount of emissions reduced by the first and second firms. Assume that with no control at all, each firm would be emitting $20$ units of emissions or a total of $10$ units for both firms.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Consider a cap-and-trade system that aims for a total reduction of $21$ units of emis-
  sions is necessary.
